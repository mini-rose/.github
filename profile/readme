mini-rose
---------

Collection of minimalistic code built with care. A lot of software these days
is overly bloated - it wants to do a lot of things apart from their main goal,
which is not ideal for a clean working enviroment.

Our software is built for programmers who want to do their own thing, by making
readable code with minimal dependencies. All of it is under the same licence:
